# Shared Feature Schema Across ClaudeCode, CodexCLI, GeminiCLI, CopilotCLI, and AMPCLI

## Common Features (Supported by All)

- **Interactive Chat Mode** - Start an interactive REPL session in the terminal.
- _ClaudeCode:_ Run claude to launch an interactive coding session[\[1\]](https://shipyard.build/blog/claude-code-cheat-sheet/#:~:text=Interactive%20mode%20,conversational%20coding%20session).
- _CodexCLI:_ Run codex to start an interactive terminal UI session[\[2\]](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/#:~:text=Run%20Codex%20in%20a%20terminal,edit%20files%2C%20and%20run%20commands).
- _GeminiCLI:_ Run gemini (after installing @google/gemini-cli) to start the Gemini agent in interactive mode.
- _CopilotCLI:_ Run copilot to enter interactive mode (you'll be prompted to trust the folder on first use)[\[3\]](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli#:~:text=Modes%20of%20use).
- _AMPCLI:_ Run amp for an interactive agent session (prompts for login on first run)[\[4\]](https://ampcode.com/manual#:~:text=Run%20interactively%20,login%20on%20first%20run).
- **Single-Prompt (Non-Interactive) Mode** - Provide one query and get output, then exit (useful for scripting).
- _ClaudeCode:_ Use print mode with -p. e.g. claude -p "Explain this function" runs once and exits[\[5\]](https://shipyard.build/blog/claude-code-cheat-sheet/#:~:text=REPL%20with%20initial%20prompt%3A%20Start,with%20a%20specific%20question).
- _CodexCLI:_ Use the non-interactive exec command. e.g. codex exec "run the tests and report results" (alias codex e) streams the result and exits[\[6\]](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference/#:~:text=match%20at%20L494%20codex%20execStable,be%20allowed%2C%20prompted%2C%20or%20blocked).
- _GeminiCLI:_ Supports a headless mode for scripting (e.g. via a flag or command in "Headless mode" section[\[7\]](https://geminicli.com/docs/#:~:text=,shortcuts%20to%20improve%20your%20workflow)). For example, gemini --exec "build the project" (flag name may vary) runs the command and exits.
- _CopilotCLI:_ Use the -p option. e.g. copilot -p "Show this week's commits" --allow-tool 'shell(git)' for a one-shot answer[\[8\]](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli#:~:text=,For%20example).
- _AMPCLI:_ Use _execute_ mode with -x. e.g. amp -x "list all TODO comments in the repo" sends the prompt, prints the final answer, and exits[\[9\]](https://ampcode.com/manual#:~:text=%24%20echo%20,%7C%20amp).
- **Codebase Awareness (File Reading)** - Agents can read code from your project to inform responses.
- _ClaudeCode:_ Automatically includes context from the current directory (and CLAUDE.md files) in prompts[\[10\]](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices#:~:text=,an%20ideal%20place%20for%20documenting). You can explicitly reference files in prompts using @&lt;path&gt;[\[11\]](https://shipyard.build/blog/claude-code-cheat-sheet/#:~:text=File%20and%20directory%20references%20).
- _CodexCLI:_ Automatically scans the workspace for relevant files. You can add extra directories with --add-dir &lt;path&gt; for context[\[12\]](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference/#:~:text=Key%20Type%20%2F%20Values%20Details,Values%20parse%20as%20JSON).
- _GeminiCLI:_ By default, has access to the current folder's files. It uses a ReAct loop with built-in tools (like file read) to gather context[\[13\]](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/gemini-cli#:~:text=provides%20access%20to%20Gemini%20directly,in%20your%20terminal).
- _CopilotCLI:_ As you work in a trusted folder, Copilot can open and read files to answer questions or make changes (after confirming trust for that directory)[\[14\]](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/use-copilot-cli#:~:text=Copilot%20will%20ask%20you%20to,the%20files%20in%20this%20folder)[\[15\]](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/use-copilot-cli#:~:text=5,the%20CLI).
- _AMPCLI:_ Loads project files into context (Amp's "Librarian" subagent aggressively searches your repo for relevant info[\[16\]](https://peterwarnock.com/blog/posts/amp-coding-agent-features/#:~:text=The%20Librarian%3A%20Specialized%20Context%20Gathering)). You can also use @file syntax to refer to specific files[\[17\]](https://ampcode.com/manual#:~:text=3,Custom%20Commands).
- **File Editing (Write Operations)** - Agents can create or modify files in the project.
- _ClaudeCode:_ Supports file writes via the Write tool (edits require confirmation unless always allowed)[\[18\]](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices#:~:text=By%20default%2C%20Claude%20Code%20requests,git%20commit). For example, run with --allowedTools "Write" to let Claude modify files without prompting[\[19\]](https://shipyard.build/blog/claude-code-cheat-sheet/#:~:text=%60,dir%20..%2Fapps%20..%2Flib).
- _CodexCLI:_ Can apply code changes to files. By default, it asks for approval before writes unless run in full-auto/sandbox mode[\[20\]](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference/#:~:text=%60,use%20inside%20an%20externally%20hardened)[\[21\]](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference/#:~:text=%60,c).
- _GeminiCLI:_ Supports file editing through its built-in tools (e.g. "file write"). It will typically prompt for confirmation before making changes unless in Yolo mode[\[22\]](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/gemini-cli#:~:text=,Web%20fetch).
- _CopilotCLI:_ Can create or edit files (e.g. "Add a new function to utils.py"). It will ask to approve the write tool on first use, or you can pre-allow it with flags like --allow-tool 'write'[\[23\]](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli#:~:text=your%20approval%3A)[\[24\]](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli#:~:text=allows%20Copilot%20to%20use%20any,shell%20command%20without%20individual%20approval).
- _AMPCLI:_ Fully supports file creation and editing. Amp will either ask for permission or use configured rules to decide if a WriteFile tool action is allowed[\[25\]](https://ampcode.com/manual#:~:text=The%20matched%20entry%20tells%20Amp,the%20decision%20to%20another%20program)[\[26\]](https://ampcode.com/manual#:~:text=%2F%2F%20Allow%20all%20playwright%20MCP,helper%22%7D).
- **Shell Command Execution** - Agents can run terminal commands (build, test, git, etc.) in the workspace.
- _ClaudeCode:_ Can execute shell commands via the Bash tool. By default it will ask for confirmation; you can allow specific commands (e.g. --allowedTools "Bash(git \*)")[\[27\]](https://shipyard.build/blog/claude-code-cheat-sheet/#:~:text=%60,disallowedTools%20%22Bash%28rm). In-session, prefix a prompt with ! to run a shell command directly[\[28\]](https://shipyard.build/blog/claude-code-cheat-sheet/#:~:text=Shell%20commands%20).
- _CodexCLI:_ Supports running shell commands. It uses a sandbox policy (configurable via --sandbox flag: e.g. --sandbox workspace-write) and an approval setting (--ask-for-approval) to control execution[\[20\]](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference/#:~:text=%60,use%20inside%20an%20externally%20hardened)[\[29\]](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference/#:~:text=%60~%2F.codex%2Fconfig.toml%60.%20%60,Omit%20to%20launch).
- _GeminiCLI:_ Has built-in shell tool access. It uses a reason-and-act loop, so it may propose shell steps (like npm test) and either auto-run them in Yolo mode or ask for approval in normal mode[\[13\]](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/gemini-cli#:~:text=provides%20access%20to%20Gemini%20directly,in%20your%20terminal)[\[22\]](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/gemini-cli#:~:text=,Web%20fetch).
- _CopilotCLI:_ Can run shell commands on your behalf. It will prompt "Allow Copilot to use tool X?" when a command like shell(git push) or others is attempted[\[30\]](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/use-copilot-cli#:~:text=For%20some%20examples%20of%20prompts%2C,see%20About%20GitHub%20Copilot%20CLI)[\[31\]](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/use-copilot-cli#:~:text=6,the%20use%20of%20the%20tool). You can bypass prompts with --allow-all-tools to let it run any command without confirmation[\[32\]](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli#:~:text=match%20at%20L461%20If%20you,considerations%2C%20later%20in%20this%20article)[\[33\]](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli#:~:text=%2A%20%60).
- _AMPCLI:_ Executes shell commands through its Bash tool. Amp uses a permission rules list to decide if a command can run, needs to ask, or should be blocked[\[25\]](https://ampcode.com/manual#:~:text=The%20matched%20entry%20tells%20Amp,the%20decision%20to%20another%20program)[\[34\]](https://ampcode.com/manual#:~:text=%7B%20,helper). You can edit these rules (amp permissions edit) to e.g. always allow certain commands.
- **Tool Permission & Approval System** - All agents have a safety mechanism to confirm or restrict actions that modify the system.
- _ClaudeCode:_ Conservative by default - it asks before using tools like file write or dangerous shell commands[\[18\]](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices#:~:text=By%20default%2C%20Claude%20Code%20requests,git%20commit). You can whitelist tools per session (--allowedTools flag) or in config to avoid repeated prompts[\[35\]](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices#:~:text=%2A%20Select%20,specific%20permissions). A "dangerous" override (--dangerously-skip-permissions) will let Claude run anything without asking[\[36\]](https://shipyard.build/blog/claude-code-cheat-sheet/#:~:text=%60,permissions).
- _CodexCLI:_ Configurable approval policy via --ask-for-approval. Options include always require approval, only on first use, etc. (untrusted | on-failure | on-request | never)[\[37\]](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference/#:~:text=%60,Run%20every%20command). It also offers --full-auto mode (sets minimal prompts + write sandbox) for low-friction operation[\[38\]](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference/#:~:text=features.%3Cname%3E%3Dtrue%60%29.%20Repeatable.%20%60,overrides). For complete bypass, --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox (aka --yolo) lets Codex run commands without any sandbox or approval[\[39\]](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference/#:~:text=%60,c%20features.%3Cname%3E%3Dtrue%60%29.%20Repeatable).
- _GeminiCLI:_ Similar approval flow - by default it will ask before executing potentially risky tools. An explicit **Yolo mode** is available to allow all actions without prompts[\[22\]](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/gemini-cli#:~:text=,Web%20fetch). You can toggle Yolo in VS Code or via CLI flags (e.g. --yolo for no confirmations).
- _CopilotCLI:_ Uses allow/deny lists for tools. You can pre-approve certain tools with --allow-tool &lt;name&gt; or everything with --allow-all-tools[\[40\]](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli#:~:text=There%20are%20three%20command,can%20use%20without%20asking%20for). By default, it will _ask_ each time an unapproved tool (like a new shell command or file write) is about to run[\[41\]](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli#:~:text=,used%20without%20manual%20approval). Trusted directories can be remembered so you don't get prompted in future sessions for that folder[\[42\]](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/use-copilot-cli#:~:text=3,options)[\[31\]](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/use-copilot-cli#:~:text=6,the%20use%20of%20the%20tool).
- _AMPCLI:_ Employs a detailed permissions system in its config. Rules can _allow_, _ask_, _reject_, or _delegate_ decisions for each tool pattern[\[43\]](https://ampcode.com/manual#:~:text=,running%20any%20other%20MCP%20tool)[\[34\]](https://ampcode.com/manual#:~:text=%7B%20,helper). By customizing amp.permissions (via amp permissions edit), you control which commands run without prompting. (There's no single "-yolo" flag; instead you'd set a catch-all rule to allow everything if desired.)
- **Model Selection** - Choose which underlying AI model or variant to use for the coding agent.
- _ClaudeCode:_ Supports multiple Claude models (e.g. Sonnet, Haiku, Opus versions). Use /model in-session or --model &lt;name&gt; flag to specify a model (e.g. claude --model claude-opus-4)[\[44\]](https://shipyard.build/blog/claude-code-cheat-sheet/#:~:text=%60,Bash%28rm).
- _CodexCLI:_ Allows switching between models like GPT-5-Codex vs GPT-5. Use the /model command or -m/--model &lt;model_name&gt; flag (for example, codex -m gpt-5-codex)[\[45\]](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference/#:~:text=approval%20on,c).
- _GeminiCLI:_ Allows selection of model versions (e.g. Gemini 2 vs Gemini 3, or "Pro" vs "Flash" speeds)[\[46\]](https://blog.google/technology/developers/introducing-gemini-cli-open-source-ai-agent/#:~:text=Gemini%20CLI%3A%20your%20open,Read%20more). Use the /model command or config to switch models (for instance, enabling Gemini 3 Pro mode in settings[\[47\]](https://geminicli.com/docs/#:~:text=,CLI)[\[48\]](https://geminicli.com/docs/#:~:text=,Themes)).
- _CopilotCLI:_ _Not user-configurable._ Copilot automatically uses the best available model based on your plan (e.g. GPT-4 for Pro+). There is no public flag to switch models; it's managed behind the scenes (aside from specialized comparison commands in documentation).
- _AMPCLI:_ Uses a _multi-model_ approach. Amp can call different models for different tasks (e.g. Claude Opus 4.5 for big contexts, GPT-5.2 for other tasks)[\[49\]](https://ampcode.com/manual#:~:text=Amp%20is%20the%20frontier%20coding,for%20your%20terminal%20and%20editor). Users can switch mode profiles: **smart** (state-of-the-art models) vs **rush** (faster, cheaper model)[\[50\]](https://ampcode.com/manual#:~:text=Amp%20has%202%20modes%3A%20,free%20usage%20across%20all%20modes)[\[51\]](https://ampcode.com/manual#:~:text=Amp%20has%202%20modes%3A). Mode can be changed via command palette or CLI (amp mode smart|rush). Individual model selection is abstracted away by Amp's modes.
- **External Tool Integration (MCP)** - Connect the agent to external services or plugins via Model Context Protocol (MCP).
- _ClaudeCode:_ Supports MCP servers to extend capabilities. For example, add a custom MCP server with claude mcp add &lt;name&gt; -- /path/to/server[\[52\]](https://shipyard.build/blog/claude-code-cheat-sheet/#:~:text=,Set%20up%20GitHub%20Actions%20integration). This lets Claude use external tools (APIs, databases, etc.) beyond built-ins.
- _CodexCLI:_ Fully supports MCP integration. You can run Codex as an MCP server (codex mcp-server) and connect to others. Tools like web search or code analysis are implemented as MCP tools[\[53\]](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/#:~:text=session,Protocol%20Give%20Codex%20access%20to). Configuration files (AGENTS.md, etc.) define available tools and context for the agent[\[54\]](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference/#:~:text=Details)[\[55\]](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference/#:~:text=%60codex%20mcp).
- _GeminiCLI:_ Has native support for MCP servers (local or remote)[\[56\]](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/gemini-cli#:~:text=,features%2C%20and%20improving%20test%20coverage). You can list and use tools via /tools or /mcp commands. For instance, Gemini's agent mode can utilize web search or Google APIs as MCP tools when enabled[\[57\]](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/gemini-cli#:~:text=The%20following%20Gemini%20CLI%20features,Code%20Assist%20for%20VS%20Code).
- _CopilotCLI:_ Supports an **MCP integration** for extended tools, though in preview. You can link custom tools or data sources (documented under _"Enhance agent mode with MCP"_ in GitHub docs). For example, connecting an issue tracker or documentation search as an external tool is possible, but there's no simple CLI flag - it requires setting up an MCP server and enabling it in Copilot CLI's config[\[58\]](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli#:~:text=,Remind%20inactive%20users)[\[59\]](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli#:~:text=some%20changes%20to%20a%20project,and%20create%20a%20pull%20request).
- _AMPCLI:_ Built with a tools & subagents architecture. Amp can act as an MCP client and server[\[60\]](https://ampcode.com/manual#:~:text=3,Keybindings). It includes subagents like _Oracle_, _Librarian_, _Painter_ as built-in integrations, and allows adding **Toolboxes** (executable scripts that Amp can call as tools)[\[61\]](https://peterwarnock.com/blog/posts/amp-coding-agent-features/#:~:text=Toolboxes%3A%20Simple%20Extensibility). MCP connectivity is configured in Amp's settings, similar to others, for example to use external services or custom AI tools[\[62\]](https://ampcode.com/manual#:~:text=4,Permissions).
- **Custom Commands / Macros** - Define reusable commands or prompt templates for frequent tasks.
- _ClaudeCode:_ Supports **slash commands** defined by the user. You can create markdown files in .claude/commands/ (project-specific) or ~/.claude/commands/ (global) to define new commands[\[63\]](https://shipyard.build/blog/claude-code-cheat-sheet/#:~:text=Custom%20slash%20commands)[\[64\]](https://shipyard.build/blog/claude-code-cheat-sheet/#:~:text=,%3E%20~%2F.claude%2Fcommands%2Fsecurity.md). These become available via /&lt;name&gt; in sessions. (For example, an optimize.md file with a prompt, then use /optimize in Claude chat to run it.)
- _CodexCLI:_ Supports custom **skills** and slash commands. You can create "skills" (task guides in Markdown) that Codex will use when relevant[\[65\]](https://shipyard.build/blog/claude-code-cheat-sheet/#:~:text=Skills). Also, typing / in Codex opens a menu of built-in and custom commands[\[66\]](https://shipyard.build/blog/claude-code-cheat-sheet/#:~:text=Built). Custom commands can be added via config or files (similar to Claude's approach, often using an AGENTS.md or config .toml to define macros).
- _GeminiCLI:_ Allows custom command definitions. It provides an **Extensions** system and a way to add new slash commands or behaviors (documented under "Custom commands" in its CLI docs)[\[67\]](https://geminicli.com/docs/#:~:text=,22)[\[68\]](https://geminicli.com/docs/#:~:text=,Release%20notes). Users can script frequently-used prompts or tool sequences and invoke them quickly in the CLI (e.g. /memory or user-defined shortcuts).
- _CopilotCLI:_ Supports custom workflows via **prompt files** and **custom agents**. You can save multi-step instructions or roles in files and use them to guide Copilot (e.g., a prompt file for a code review persona)[\[69\]](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/use-copilot-cli#:~:text=,229). GitHub's docs provide examples ("your first prompt file", "custom agent") for setting these up. While not a simple slash command, you can achieve similar reuse by using copilot -p "\$(cat file.md)" or the upcoming _Spark_ and _custom agent_ features to load predefined instructions.
- _AMPCLI:_ Offers custom **Amp Commands**. Amp lets you open a command palette (with / or Ctrl+O) to access built-ins and user-defined commands. In the manual's CLI section, you can define custom commands in your config or via "Amp Tab" (for quick actions)[\[70\]](https://ampcode.com/manual#:~:text=6,16). Additionally, Amp's **Toolboxes** feature allows adding new scripted tools, which is another way to extend functionality with custom operations[\[61\]](https://peterwarnock.com/blog/posts/amp-coding-agent-features/#:~:text=Toolboxes%3A%20Simple%20Extensibility).

## Partially Supported Features (Subset of Tools Support Them)

- **Resume or Fork Session** - Continue a past conversation in a new run.
- _ClaudeCode:_ **Supported:** Use claude -c to continue the last session, or claude --resume &lt;session-id&gt; to resume a specific saved session[\[71\]](https://shipyard.build/blog/claude-code-cheat-sheet/#:~:text=%60,permissions).
- _CodexCLI:_ **Supported:** Has codex resume to pick up a previous session (with --last for the most recent)[\[72\]](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference/#:~:text=)[\[73\]](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference/#:~:text=%60,continue%20the%20most%20recent%20session). Also supports codex fork to branch a session into a new thread[\[74\]](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference/#:~:text=).
- _GeminiCLI:_ **Supported:** Provides session management; you can likely resume prior sessions (the docs mention session management features, similar to Codex's resume). For example, resuming the last session in the current directory is possible through a command or option (e.g. gemini resume --last).
- _CopilotCLI:_ **Not supported:** Each copilot session starts fresh. There is no built-in command to recall or continue a past CLI session (conversations are not saved between runs in the CLI).
- _AMPCLI:_ **Supported:** Amp saves **Threads** (conversation history). You can list and reopen threads via the command palette or web UI, and even share them[\[75\]](https://ampcode.com/manual#:~:text=Thread%20Sharing)[\[76\]](https://ampcode.com/manual#:~:text=After%20installing%20and%20signing%20in%2C,to%20start%20the%20Amp%20CLI). For instance, use the CLI command palette to select a previous thread to continue, or reference an old thread by ID to bring context (Amp's /thread: open functionality).
- **Multi-Directory Context** - Using multiple project roots or including external directories for context.
- _ClaudeCode:_ **Yes:** You can add additional directories for Claude to consider with the --add-dir flag (e.g. claude --add-dir ../lib to include another codebase)[\[77\]](https://shipyard.build/blog/claude-code-cheat-sheet/#:~:text=Flag%20Description%20Example%20%60,dir%20..%2Fapps%20..%2Flib).
- _CodexCLI:_ **Yes:** Supports granting access to extra paths via --add-dir &lt;path&gt; (repeatable)[\[12\]](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference/#:~:text=Key%20Type%20%2F%20Values%20Details,Values%20parse%20as%20JSON). Also --cd &lt;path&gt; can start the agent in a specific working dir[\[78\]](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference/#:~:text=%60,use%20inside%20an%20externally%20hardened).
- _GeminiCLI:_ **Partial:** Primarily works within one root directory (the current folder). It doesn't have a specific --add-dir flag in docs, but you could achieve similar results by starting separate agents per folder or using its "Trusted Folders" config for multi-root awareness. No one-step flag for multiple dirs.
- _CopilotCLI:_ **No:** Works on one project folder at a time (the directory you launch it in). There is no support for attaching extra directories in a single session.
- _AMPCLI:_ **Partial:** Amp focuses on one repository/workspace at a time. It does not offer a simple flag to attach another arbitrary directory. (If needed, one could integrate an external directory via a custom tool or by merging context, but not natively via CLI option.)
- **Web Search / Internet Access** - Having the agent search the web for information.
- _ClaudeCode:_ **No:** Claude Code does not have built-in web access in the CLI. It relies only on local context and the model's knowledge (though you could manually feed results).
- _CodexCLI:_ **Yes:** Has a built-in web_search tool. Enabling the --search flag grants Codex permission to use web search during a session[\[29\]](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference/#:~:text=%60~%2F.codex%2Fconfig.toml%60.%20%60,Omit%20to%20launch). For example, codex --search "How to implement X?" lets it fetch up-to-date info online.
- _GeminiCLI:_ **Yes:** Supports web access. The Gemini CLI can perform web searches and fetch URLs as tools (when allowed)[\[22\]](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/gemini-cli#:~:text=,Web%20fetch). This allows it to get documentation or other info from the internet if needed.
- _CopilotCLI:_ **No (native):** Copilot CLI doesn't natively browse the web. It operates on local code and its trained knowledge. (Advanced users could connect a custom MCP tool to call an API, but there's no out-of-the-box web search feature in Copilot CLI.)
- _AMPCLI:_ **No (native):** Amp does not directly integrate a web search tool by default. It emphasizes repository context and internal knowledge. (You could extend Amp with a custom "web fetch" Toolbox, but it's not a built-in feature of the CLI.)
- **Image or PDF Input** - Supplying images or PDFs for the agent to analyze (e.g. for UI or text extraction).
- _ClaudeCode:_ **Not supported:** Claude Code (as of now) cannot accept image inputs, only text code and instructions.
- _CodexCLI:_ **Supported:** You can attach images to the prompt using the --image (or -i) flag[\[21\]](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference/#:~:text=%60,c). For example, codex -i diagram.png -p "Generate code based on this diagram" will have Codex analyze _diagram.png_ alongside the prompt.
- _GeminiCLI:_ **Supported:** Gemini is multimodal. It can take images or PDFs as input (as evidenced by Gemini CLI's ability to "generate apps from images or PDFs"[\[79\]](https://geminicli.com/#:~:text=%26%20deploy%20with%20AI)). In practice, you might use a command or drag-and-drop in the TUI to provide an image, or a flag similar to Codex's (e.g. gemini -i design.png).
- _CopilotCLI:_ **Not supported:** Copilot CLI does not accept images or PDFs as input. It only works with code and text prompts.
- _AMPCLI:_ **Supported:** Amp CLI can handle images via its **Painter** subagent[\[80\]](https://ampcode.com/manual#:~:text=8,16). For instance, you could reference an image in a prompt (Amp might OCR it or use a vision model) - e.g., amp "Read diagram from image: file://architecture.png". This is an advanced feature, but Amp's design supports it (images are covered in its manual).
- **Automated Hooks & Triggers** - Performing automatic actions (formatting, tests, etc.) after certain agent events.
- _ClaudeCode:_ **Yes:** Provides hooks in settings. For example, you can configure a PostToolUse hook to auto-format code after a write - e.g., run Black on Python files after Claude writes them[\[81\]](https://shipyard.build/blog/claude-code-cheat-sheet/#:~:text=Example%3A%20Auto)[\[82\]](https://shipyard.build/blog/claude-code-cheat-sheet/#:~:text=,%7D%20%5D%20%7D). Hooks can trigger on events like session start, before/after tool use, etc.
- _CodexCLI:_ **Limited:** Codex CLI doesn't expose a user-friendly hook system in the CLI. (It has an internal policy engine and "execpolicy" to evaluate if commands would be allowed[\[83\]](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference/#:~:text=codex%20execStable%20Run%20Codex%20non,be%20allowed%2C%20prompted%2C%20or%20blocked), but not a general-purpose automation hook for end users.) Most automation would be done by scripting around the CLI rather than in it.
- _GeminiCLI:_ **Yes (Experimental):** Gemini CLI supports hooks (experimental)[\[84\]](https://geminicli.com/docs/#:~:text=,Best%20practices). You can write custom hook scripts that execute on certain events, similar to Claude's approach, though this is mainly for advanced users and might require enabling pre-release features.
- _CopilotCLI:_ **No:** Copilot CLI doesn't have a mechanism for user-defined hooks triggered by agent actions. Any additional automation (like running linters after edits) must be done manually or via external scripts.
- _AMPCLI:_ **Yes:** Amp's design allows extensive automation. While it doesn't call them "hooks," you can achieve similar outcomes via the permission delegate or Toolboxes. For example, an Amp **Toolbox** script could be invoked automatically as part of a workflow (and Amp's config could be set to always run tests after certain file writes, by having the agent instructed via AGENTS.md or a custom skill). Amp focuses on orchestrating subagents, so you can embed automated checks (like its code review tool in the editor, which is not yet in CLI per blog) - effectively yes, though configured differently than a simple hooks JSON.
- **Context Reset / Handoff** - Safely transitioning when context becomes too large or irrelevant (starting a fresh thread with summary of old).
- _ClaudeCode:_ **Partial:** Offers a /compact slash command (in some versions) to summarize and compress the current conversation, which helps when approaching token limits. It's a rudimentary form of context reset.
- _CodexCLI:_ **No explicit feature:** The user would manually start a new session when needed. Codex does not have a built-in context handoff tool, aside from forking sessions manually.
- _GeminiCLI:_ **No explicit user command:** Likely handled by the user or automatically if needed. No known "handoff" command in CLI.
- _CopilotCLI:_ **No:** You'd simply restart copilot if you need a fresh context; there is no built-in summary-then-reset feature.
- _AMPCLI:_ **Yes:** Amp has a **Handoff** feature for smart context transitions[\[85\]](https://peterwarnock.com/blog/posts/amp-coding-agent-features/#:~:text=Handoff%3A%20Smart%20Context%20Transitions). Instead of blindly continuing in an overloaded thread, amp can generate a new thread with a distilled summary of the prior context that you can edit before proceeding. This provides a controlled fresh start without losing key info, unique to Amp (inspired by Claude's approach but more sophisticated).
